# Linux eBPF JIT verification

This repository contains a tool for formally verifying
the Linux BPF JITs that builds
on our verification framework [Serval].

We used this tool to help develop the RV32 BPF JIT
(in `arch/riscv/net/bpf_jit_comp32.c`).

We also used this tool to find the bugs in the RV64 BPF JIT
([1e692f09e091]),
and also to review the patches that add support for far jumps and branching:

- [[PATCH bpf-next 2/8] riscv, bpf: add support for far branching](https://lore.kernel.org/bpf/20191209173136.29615-3-bjorn.topel@gmail.com/T/#u)
- [[PATCH bpf-next 3/8] riscv, bpf: add support for far jumps and exits](https://lore.kernel.org/bpf/20191209173136.29615-4-bjorn.topel@gmail.com/T/#u)

## How to install dependencies

- [Racket] (tested on v7.6 and v7.6-cs)
- [Serval]

After installing Racket, install a good version of Serval with

```sh
git clone --recursive 'https://github.com/uw-unsat/bpf-jit-verif.git'
cd bpf-jit-verif
raco pkg install --auto ./serval
```

```

runs all of the verification test cases in parallel
using 8 jobs. You can also run
individual files for a specific class of instructions,
e.g.,

```sh
raco test racket/test/rv64/verify-alu32-x.rkt
```

## Finding bugs via verification

As an example, let's inject a bug fixed in commit [1e692f09e091].
Specifically, remove the zero extension for `BPF_ALU|BPF_ADD|BPF_X`
in `racket/rv64/bpf_jit_riscv64.rkt`:

```
    [(list (or 'BPF_ALU 'BPF_ALU64) 'BPF_ADD 'BPF_X)
     (emit (if is64 (rv_add rd rd rs) (rv_addw rd rd rs)) ctx)
     (when (! is64)
       (emit_zext_32 rd ctx))]
```

Now we have a buggy JIT implementation:

```
    [(list (or 'BPF_ALU 'BPF_ALU64) 'BPF_ADD 'BPF_X)
     (emit (if is64 (rv_add rd rd rs) (rv_addw rd rd rs)) ctx)]
```

Run the verification:

```sh
raco test racket/test/rv64/verify-alu32-x.rkt
```

Verification will fail with a counterexample:

```
Running test "VERIFY (BPF_ALU BPF_ADD BPF_X)"
--------------------
riscv64-alu32-x tests > VERIFY (BPF_ALU BPF_ADD BPF_X)

   [off$0 (bv #x8000 16)]))
--------------------
```

The counterexample produced by the tool gives
BPF register values that will trigger the bug:
it chooses r0 to be 0x0000000080000000
and r1 to be 0x0000000000000000. This demonstrates
the bug because the RISC-V instructions sign extend
the result of the 32-bit addition, where the BPF instruction
performs zero extension.

## Verification

The verification works by proving equivalence
between a BPF instruction and the RISC-V instructions
generated by the JIT for that instruction.

As a concrete example, consider verifying the `BPF_ALU|BPF_ADD|BPF_X`
instruction. The verification starts by constructing a _symbolic_ BPF
instruction where the destination and source register fields can
take on any legit value:

```
BPF_ALU32_REG(BPF_ADD, {{rd}}, {{rs}})
```

Next, the verifier symbolically evaluates the JIT on the BPF
instruction, producing a set of possible sequences of symbolic
RISC-V instructions:

```
addw {{rv_reg(rd)}} {{rv_reg(rd)}} {{rv_reg(rs)}}
slli {{rv_reg(rd)}} {{rv_reg(rd)}} 32
srli {{rv_reg(rd)}} {{rv_reg(rd)}} 32
```

Here, `rv_reg` denotes the RISC-V register associated
with a particular BPF register.

Next, the tool proves that every possible sequence of generated
RISC-V instructions has the equivalent behavior as the original BPF
instruction, for all possible choices of registers `rd` and `rs`,
and for all initial values of all RISC-V general-purpose registers.
To do so, it leverages automated verifiers provided by the [Serval]
verification framework, as follows.

The verifier starts with a symbolic BPF state and symbolic RISC-V
state, called `bpf-state` and `riscv-state`, assuming that the two
initial states match, e.g., `riscv-state[rv_reg(reg)] == bpf-state[reg]`
for all `reg`.  Next, it runs the Serval BPF and RISC-V verifiers
on the BPF instruction over `bpf-state` and every possible sequence
of generated RISC-V instructions over `riscv-state`, respectively.
It then proves that the final BPF
and RISC-V states still match.

Support for more complex instructions, such as jumps and branches,
requires additional care. For the details, you can see the JIT
correctness definition in `lib/bpf-common.rkt:verify-jit-refinement`.
This complexity comes from having to prove that the generated
instructions preserve a correspondence between the BPF program
counter and the RISC-V program counter.

## Synthesis for the RV32 JIT

To help develop and optimize the RV32 JIT, we used Rosette's
program synthesis feature to synthesize per-instruction
compilers for a subset of BPF instructions.
The synthesis process takes as input the BPF and RISC-V interpreters
from Serval, the BPF JIT correctness specification, and a program
sketch which describes the structure of the code to search for.
Synthesis then exhaustively searches increasingly large candidate
sequences in the search space until it finds one that satisfies
the JIT correctness specification.

You can try this feature out by running the following:

```sh
raco test racket/test/rv32/synthesize-alu64-x.rkt
```

Note that this test will attempt to use the [Boolector]
SMT solver first; if you do not have it installed it
will fall back to Rosette's provided Z3, which may take
significantly longer (more than 10x slower on my laptop).
It will produce output similar to the following:

```
riscv32-alu64-x synthesis
Running test "SYNTHESIZE (BPF_ALU64 BPF_SUB BPF_X)"
Using solver #<boolector>
Synthesizing for op '(BPF_ALU64 BPF_SUB BPF_X) with size 0
Synthesizing for op '(BPF_ALU64 BPF_SUB BPF_X) with size 1
Synthesizing for op '(BPF_ALU64 BPF_SUB BPF_X) with size 2
Synthesizing for op '(BPF_ALU64 BPF_SUB BPF_X) with size 3
Synthesizing for op '(BPF_ALU64 BPF_SUB BPF_X) with size 4

Solution found for '(BPF_ALU64 BPF_SUB BPF_X):
void emit_op(u8 rd, u8 rs, s32 imm, struct rv_jit_context *ctx) {
    emit(rv_sub(RV_REG_T1, hi(rd), hi(rs)), ctx);
    emit(rv_sltu(RV_REG_T0, lo(rd), lo(rs)), ctx);
    emit(rv_sub(hi(rd), RV_REG_T1, RV_REG_T0), ctx);
    emit(rv_sub(lo(rd), lo(rd), lo(rs)), ctx);
}

cpu time: 978 real time: 66937 gc time: 49
```

In this example, synthesis was able to find a sequence of
four RV32 instructions that correctly emulate the behavior
of a `BPF_ALU64 BPF_SUB BPF_X` instruction. This solution
is printed out as a C function `emit_op`.
You can see how this is integrated into the final JIT
in `arch/riscv/net/bpf_jit_comp32.c`,
in the `emit_rv32_alu_r64` function, in the
`BPF_SUB` case. Note that the instructions in the JIT may
be different than the solution the solver on your machine
happens to find.

You can play around with synthesizing other instructions
by looking in the other `racket/test/rv32/synthesize-*.rkt` files,
and uncommenting cases for other instructions in those files.

Not every instruction sequence in the final JIT was found using synthesis.
Many synthesis queries either take extremely long or do not
produce any results: especially those that require very long
instruction sequences (e.g., 64-bit shifts), or those that
use non-linear arithmetic (multiplication, division, etc.)
For these instructions, we manually write an implementation
and verify the correctness using the other techniques described
in this guide.

## Generating the RV32 JIT

The RV32 JIT is split in two parts: the Racket implementation
in `racket/rv32/bpf_jit_comp32.rkt` contains the code required
for generating RV32 instruction sequences for a given BPF instruction,
and `racket/rv32/bpf_jit_comp32.c.tmpl` is a template containing
glue C code required to have the JIT interface compile in C and
interface with the rest of the kernel. The template
contains holes that are filled in by extracting the corresponding Racket
source code to C.

The final C code in `arch/riscv/net/bpf_jit_comp32.c` can be generated
from these two components via:

```sh
make arch/riscv/net/bpf_jit_comp32.c
```

This file can be copied to the Linux kernel source tree for building
and testing.

## Caveats / limitations

The test cases under `racket/test/` show which instructions
the JIT is currently verified for. For those instructions,
it proves that the JIT is correct for all possible initial
register values, for all jump offsets, for all immediate values, etc.

There are several properties of the JIT that
are currently not specified or verified:

- Memory instructions (e.g. `BPF_LD`, `BPF_ST`, etc.)
- JIT prologue and epilogue
- 64-bit immediate load (`BPF_LD | BPF_IMM | BPF_DW`)
- Call instructions (e.g., `BPF_CALL`, `BPF_TAIL_CALL`)
- `build_body`: the verification proves the JIT correct
  for individual BPF instructions at a time.
- The loop in `bpf_int_jit_compile`: verification assumes
  the `ctx->offset` mapping has already been correctly
  constructed by previous iterations.
- The verified JIT is a manual Rosette port of the C version:
  mismatches in this translation can mean there are bugs
  in the C version not present in the verified one.
- The verification assumes that the BPF program being compiled
  passed the kernel's BPF verifier: e.g., it assumes no
  divide-by-zero or out-of-range shifts.
- Verification makes assumptions on the total size of the
  compiled BPF program for jumps: it assumes that the number of BPF
  instructions is less than 16,777,216; and that the total number
  of generated RISC-V instructions is less than 134,217,728.
  These bounds can be increased but will increase overall
  verification time for jumps.
